Overview
This nested CloudFormation template deploys a highly available three-tier web application architecture on AWS. It consists of the following components:

VPC: 
A virtual private cloud with public and private subnets, a NAT gateway for internet access from private subnets, and security groups for controlled traffic flow.

Load Balancer: 
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) that distributes traffic across web servers.

Auto Scaling Group: 
A group of EC2 instances running web servers, managed by the load balancer and scaling based on CPU utilization.

Target Group: 
A target group that registers the instances with the load balancer.

Launch Template: A template for launching EC2 instances with the necessary configuration.

Scaling Policies: Policies to automatically scale the Auto Scaling Group in or out based on CPU utilization.

SNS Topic: A topic for notifying operators about scaling events.

Prerequisites
An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create CloudFormation stacks.
The AWS CLI installed and configured.
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for the EC2 instances.

Deployment
Save the template as template.yaml.

Deploy the template using the AWS CLI:


aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name <your-stack-name> --parameter-overrides EnvironmentName=<your-environment-name> InstanceType=<your-instance-type> OperatorEMail=<your-email>

Provide values for the parameters as prompted.

Outputs
The template outputs the following values:

LoadBalancerDNSName: The DNS name of the load balancer.
Additional Information
The template creates a VPC endpoint for S3 to allow private access from the instances.
The instances are configured with the Amazon SSM Agent for remote management.
The instances install a simple HTTP server and create a basic "Hello World" web page as an 

Troubleshooting
Check the CloudFormation console for stack events and error logs.

Use the AWS CLI to describe stack events and resources:

aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name <your-stack-name>
aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name <your-stack-name>


Security
The template creates security groups to control traffic flow between resources.
The template uses a parameter for the operator's email address to ensure confidentiality.

Customization
Modify the template parameters to customize the deployment for your specific needs.
Add or remove resources as needed.
